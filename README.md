For example, imagine you have **10 TikTok accounts** and you need to schedule content for each one. Doing this manually on TikTok would be quite time-consuming and complicated. Instead, with this Excel-based program, you can manage and develop your content more easily. Thanks to the flexibility of **Excel**, you can see all your social media content at a glance and make quick edits when needed.

Another advantage of the program is that social media content is securely stored on your computer and easily managed. This way, all the content you produce is stored in an organized manner and can be quickly accessed when needed. 

You can also categorize your content by date, topic and other criteria, allowing you to plan your social media more strategically.

In summary, this program significantly improves the way you plan, manage and optimize your social media content. It provides great convenience for users with multiple accounts and is an indispensable tool for professional social media managers.

## How to use the program, what is the standard filing style?

The first step is to access the folder of the social media site that we will be working on. As you can see in the image below, the folders of the main social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter are located in this section.

In this step, since we plan to focus primarily on **TikTok**, we log in directly to the TikTok folder. This folder contains all the tools and files to plan and manage TikTok-specific content.

Depending on needs and preferences, necessary revisions can be made to the code. With this flexibility, you can effectively manage and optimize your content on both platforms.

This process helps you organize your social media content more efficiently and develop a cohesive sharing strategy across both platforms.

After openning in to the **TikTok folder**, you will see TikTok accounts where you can schedule sharing. You can share videos by managing and organizing the content in the folders of these TikTok accounts.

Within the TikTok folder, there are subfolders belonging to various TikTok accounts. Each folder in the image below represents a specific TikTok account. These folders contain TikTok videos that are scheduled to be shared on the respective accounts. In each account folder, you can find and organize content specific to that account and manage the sharing process.

In each account folder, you can find and manage **TikTok videos** specific to that account. Thanks to this structure, you can organize the content of each account separately and follow the sharing processes more regularly. As you can see below, .mp4 format files are uploaded to the folder for planning purposes. All content found here can be shared.

As we approach the final stages, organizing the Excel Sheet is critical to developing an effective social media strategy. Each Excel Sheet represents an owned TikTok account. With this Excel Planning file, content descriptions, sharing dates and times are efficiently organized.
